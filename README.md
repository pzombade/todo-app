This is a simple Todo web application.

  - Add todo tasks.
  - Mark one or more todos as complete.
  - Update existing todo.
  - Delete one or more todos.
  - Supported multiple languages, i.e., English, German and SimplifiedChinese.


## Backlog Items:

  - Authorization and authentication is a must.
  - Import and export of todos in excel/csv/xml/json/pdf formats.
